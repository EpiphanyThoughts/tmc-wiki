Chunk savestate is a bug found by Xcom, Skyrising and EarthComputer.
Its used to make long portals or dupe items. The bug is based on
overloading the chunk with data, if the chunk size goes over 1mb
it wont save. Most common way to overload the chunk is with books
what have lot of different characters making them very large. 
Its possible to get bookbanned if you have too much of them in up
your inventory. Mojang patched the bug in 1.15 for being a dupe exploit.
